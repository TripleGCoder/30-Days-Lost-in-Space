# ðŸš¨ English To Morse Code
After Learning how to turn on and off an LED light in a circuit on a breadboard; Watching it blink on, then off. Looking at the blinking light. The red bright blinking light, eluminating my desk looked like someone was trying to send me a message through morse code. And then it Hit. With my little knowledge of C++ I decided to do a little research on c++ syntax and decided to build a msg to Morse code translator. 

##**How It's Made:**
Tech used: C++ Arduino, Python

Having very little knowledge of Arduino C++ 


Optimizations
(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or wow I actually did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
