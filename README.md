# **🚀 30 Days Lost in Space**

Welcome, Explorer. You’ve stumbled onto my logbook for Inventr.io’s Adventure Kit: 30 Days Lost in Space. After crash landing on a mysterious alien world, I face the challenge of repairing my shuttle one wire at a time. Through hands-on electronics and coding, each mission brings me closer to escape and survival.

## **This repo contains:**

	🌌 Daily Missions – The structured lessons from the course (HERO board + Arduino IDE).

	🛠️ Build Off Projects – Fun side experiments where I expanded on what I learned each day.

	🎨 Creative Days – My own twists, custom circuits, and coding challenges inspired by the adventure.

## 📂 Project Structure

	Day X/ → Official daily challenge projects.

	Build Offs/ → Side quests where I applied and stretched the concepts.

	Creative/ → Experimental ideas, extra projects, and alien-tech improvisations.

## ⚙️ Tools & Components

All projects use the Adventure Kit parts, including:
- HERO Board (Arduino Uno compatible)
- Breadboard, LEDs, Resistors
- DIP Switch, Keypad, OLED Display, 7-Segment Display
- Passive Buzzer, Rotary Encoder, and more

## 🏆 Goals

1. Learn and practice Arduino coding (C++)
2. Build circuits that control real hardware
3. Apply creativity to expand each day’s challenge
4. Document everything in this repo to track progress

## 📑 Progress Log

	Day 1 → Blink test on HERO board (first light = first hope)
	Day 2 → Breadboard + external LED circuit (cabin lights online!)
 			- Build Off #1 → Morse code transmitter using LED
	(…more to come as I progress through the 30 days!)
